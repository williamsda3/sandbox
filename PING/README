This is a base level implementation of a the PING netowrking tool.
I created both a Client and Server that will both communicate to each other.
The purpose of the program is to see the RTT (round-trip-time) of a packet, this can give an estamate of network perfomance.
To visualise how the PING tool opperaties using a UDP connection, packet loss is added on the Server side to also allow an implementation of 
loss handling on the Client side 

The user can play around with sending different packet amounts and 'packet timeout' time, they can also set the packet loss percentage on the Server side.

Overall this was fun to make and play around with!
